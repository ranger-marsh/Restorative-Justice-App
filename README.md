I was tasked with referring individuals to a restorative justice community court. This court allows people to repair the harm of their crimes without getting criminal record. to learn more about restorative justice visit https://goo.gl/Vcv9Hj. 

I was provided a large excel file with information about all arrest. This excel file is generated from proprietary software and some rather basic functionality is missing. I have to sort the arrest based on criteria set forth by the restorative justice program. I then have to background and subsequently recommend individuals to the program. 

This Application helps me do that by sorting the excel file and creating face-sheets for each candidate that needs backgrounding. It also keeps a rolling case log of previously investigated cases. For now I am stuck using excel based on the needs of other stakeholders involved with the program. I would rather be using a database. 

I started doing this headless, from the command line, but wanted others involved to be able to use the functionality. 

Programming/software development is not my background or day job.
