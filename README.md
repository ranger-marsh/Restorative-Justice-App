This application makes a marked improvement on a process that deeply affects individuals. 

I was tasked with referring individuals to a restorative justice community court. This court allows people to repair the harm of their crimes without getting criminal record. to learn more about restorative justice visit [Wikipedia](https://goo.gl/Vcv9Hj). 

I was provided a large csv file with information about all arrest. This csv file is generated from proprietary software and some rather basic functionality is missing. I have to sort the arrest based on criteria set forth by the restorative justice program. I then have to background and subsequently recommend individuals to the program. 

This Application helps me do that by sorting the csv file and creating face-sheets for each candidate that needs backgrounding. The app uses a sqlite3 database that filters the data and prevents duplicates from being entered.  

I started doing this headless, from the command line, but wanted others involved to be able to use the functionality.

Below is a video demo of an older version but it still shows the basic concepts.
